/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2277-149897-0012.wav,98958,"if he only had that letter back, he wouldn't send it."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2277-149897-0024.wav,93998,it seemed as if his family troubles were just beginning.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2277-149897-0027.wav,112558,he would go to her and tell her all his family complications.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2277-149897-0028.wav,116078,he would explain to her just where he stood and how much he needed her.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2277-149897-0031.wav,141038,he traveled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2277-149897-0035.wav,110478,"very truly yours, etc compromise."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153947-0002.wav,211118,on my return i purposely avoided looking into it until i had sent back my last revises to the printer.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153947-0006.wav,373838,"but this had an effect of which i have little reason to complain for. i was allowed, almost to call them lifelong self deceivers to their faces, and they said it was quite true, but that it did not matter."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153947-0012.wav,63438,there was also another cause.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153948-0005.wav,100558,i was delighted with the country and the manner of life.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153948-0006.wav,531758,"i was to see the sheep not necessarily close at hand or to get them in a single mob, but to see enough of them here in there to feel easy that nothing had gone wrong."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153948-0010.wav,93358,the country was the grandest that can be imagined.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153948-0013.wav,273358,"i had no money, but if i could only find workable country i might stock it with borrowed capital and consider myself a made man."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153948-0015.wav,110958,i would try the nearer range and see how far i could go.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0001.wav,312078,"my guides, however, were well known and the natural politeness of the people prevented them from putting me to any inconvenience, but they could not help eyeing me, nor i them."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0005.wav,187118,"each feature was finished, eyelids eyelashes and ears being almost invariably perfect."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0006.wav,327118,"their expression was divine, and as they glanced at me timidly. but with parted lips and great bewilderment, i forgot all thoughts of their conversion and feelings that were far more earthly."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0008.wav,87598,the men were as handsome as the women beautiful.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0009.wav,333518,"i have always delighted in an reverenced beauty, but i felt simply abashed in the presence of such a splendid type, a compound of all that is best in egyptian, greek, and italian."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0011.wav,189998,i expressed by signs my admiration and pleasure to my guides and they were greatly pleased.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0013.wav,125358,i saw a few sheep with rounded. nose is an enormous tails.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0019.wav,239598,"but by and by they came to my watch, which i had hidden away in the inmost pocket, that i had and had forgotten when they began their search."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0023.wav,84878,this had some effect in calming him.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2412-153954-0024.wav,134158,he began presently to relent and spoke to me in a kind or manner.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0001.wav,66318,festive yes.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0002.wav,136398,"the reply was written in a sprawling, feminine hand. it was a little vague."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0004.wav,60238,the whole thing was a trifle odd.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0009.wav,59278,i had no illusions.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0014.wav,70958,it was a horrible journey.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0015.wav,70318,he was impervious to reason.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0022.wav,63278,i did not know what he meant.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0023.wav,83278,"i did not ask, i was beyond it."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0024.wav,136078,"i was chilled to the bone, wet, tired, hungry."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0026.wav,100558,here we be.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0028.wav,128078,there's a knocker if none of them haven't twisted it off.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0029.wav,201518,"there appeared to be no knocker, though, whether it had been twisted off, was more than i could say."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0030.wav,116078,"no answer, though i allowed a more than decent interval."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0032.wav,101678,maybe they're up to some of their games and wants rousing.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0034.wav,259918,"presently, feet were heard advancing along the passage. several pairs, it seemed onelight gleaming through the window over the door."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0035.wav,87278,a voice inquired who's there?
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0036.wav,147278,the information was greeted with what sounded uncommonly like a chorus of laughter.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83699-0037.wav,204718,"there was a rush of retreating feet and expostulating voice, then darkness again and silence."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0003.wav,68718,it is most delightful.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0005.wav,136558,"for instance, look at their behavior in the matter of the ring."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0007.wav,106638,the girl is fretting but you don't seem to notice it.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0008.wav,115758,i guessed.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0009.wav,67918,that's it on your account.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0016.wav,116558,there were no signs of faltering about her flow of language.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0019.wav,162478,"and of course, i had my expectations and she had hers."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0020.wav,176878,it was plain that together we should manage most comfortably delightfulee in fact.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0024.wav,158158,and i will see that there is no shirking about the boys or about the girls either.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0025.wav,315118,"i have drawn up a list of all the people who ought to give us a present, and i shall tell them what they ought to give."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0026.wav,326638,"of course there are some people with whom you can't be perfectly plain, but i shall be as plain as i can. there's a way, in a manner of doing that kind of thing."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0028.wav,296078,"she has a knack of getting people to do what she wishes and to give her what she wants, which is a little short of miraculous."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0029.wav,186638,i notice that they are generally persons who have already tendered their offerings.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0031.wav,86638,such as the selfishness of human nature.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0032.wav,208078,but why on that account they should pity me? i altogether failed to understand.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0036.wav,62798,someone?
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0037.wav,299758,i cannot pretend to explain why except on the supposition that romance is dead.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2428-83705-0038.wav,233838,"as it is, unless i am mistaken, some of the rending will be on our side and they know it."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0001.wav,119278,"i tell you it is not poisoned, she cried."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0002.wav,222958,since his birth he has been guarded so closely that the cleverest poisonous of the east could not reach him.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0007.wav,174478,not until the heavens were in the proper order could they perform this necromancy.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0010.wav,104078,point of contact inquired the other.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0011.wav,239118,"all discarded portions of the human body still remain part of it, attached to it by intangible connections."

/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0015.wav,172238,they seek to snap the silver cord that binds me to my dying body.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0016.wav,287118,they cluster around me. their hands are talent. their eyes are red like flame burning in darkness.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0017.wav,92398,their fingers seremi like fire.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0020.wav,177838,"your cry and the grip of your fingers brought me back, but i am going fast."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0021.wav,127438,there was the old imperious note in his failing whisper.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-118436-0022.wav,145358,"you have never disobeyed me, obey my last command."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-136532-0000.wav,313998,they also found a martian calendar.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-136532-0007.wav,179438,it was locked from the inside and we had to burn it down with the torch. that's where they are.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-136532-0009.wav,116078,"well, of course they're dead. what a question."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-136532-0020.wav,95278,bring it to the public attention. dramatize it.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-136532-0021.wav,209678,so i believe i shall go back at least for awhile and see what i can do.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-136532-0022.wav,49198,lectures
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-137823-0000.wav,109998,"i'll be glad to try, sir, he replied."

/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/251-137823-0025.wav,117198,"male or female, human or animal?"
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2803-154320-0003.wav,207278,their minds were so distracted at this change of route's. to be quite unhinged.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2803-154320-0005.wav,152718,his eyes wandered ceaselessly over the blank horizon.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2803-154320-0010.wav,128398,"we would fight to the death, of course, but after that."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2803-154320-0013.wav,139758,so that and that scored there is little or no danger.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2803-154328-0002.wav,65998,the meal ended.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2803-154328-0003.wav,409678,"sleep which keeps all sorrow in advance, soon way down their eyelids they slept in each others arms overcome by exhaustion and prolonged watching."

/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2902-9006-0011.wav,138478,and the new blood at the era of this story was at hand.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/2902-9006-0020.wav,173678,i cannot hope that these pages will be altogether free from anachronisms and errors.

/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3000-15664-0004.wav,92398,but it is far better to go afoot.

/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0018.wav,56878,what does he want?
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0021.wav,93198,i emphasized complacently.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0025.wav,83758,i wish we had not left so soon.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0027.wav,127278,"however, a little later we had a comfortable chat."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0029.wav,220398,the suggestion he had laughed at was not so entirely foolish as he had been pleased to consider it.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0032.wav,118158,it's the most inexplicable there.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0033.wav,87438,but clues there are absolutely none.

/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0060.wav,87758,and she speaks of no weapon.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0063.wav,55758,no doubt.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0065.wav,105038,not altogether by me.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0066.wav,150478,wherever she pleases only i can't walk far.
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0068.wav,81038,but they'll put a man on for you.

/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0075.wav,79278,"yes, many times."
/home/ubuntu/KerasDeepSpeech/dataset/3081-166546-0076.wav,62158,what made the difference?
